      <h3> About me</h3>
      <p>I grew up in Kalamazoo, MI. My journey <br>
         the world of user experience began <br>
         a fascination for understanding human behavior. <br>
         Drawing on my background in behavioral psychology, I bring <br>
          a perspective on the human mind and how people think. I am always<br>
          curious about the decisions people make and why they make them. <br>
          I see an exciting opportunity to design thoughtful solutions that improve outcomes. </p>
